🌴 Project Proposal: KiloKōkua – The Hawaiʻi Climate AI Concierge
🧠 Summary
KiloKōkua ("Observation Helper") is an AI-powered chatbot designed to make Hawaiʻi’s climate data more accessible, engaging, and useful for the public. Whether you’re a student curious about rainfall patterns, a researcher hunting for historical temperature data, or a policymaker needing quick insight into regional drought trends — KiloKōkua provides fast, accurate, and conversational access to climate information.

🎯 Objective
To develop a conversational AI system that enables users to ask natural language questions about Hawaiʻi’s climate and receive real-time, accurate responses. The bot will streamline access to existing climate datasets through a user-friendly interface, increasing public awareness and aiding in data-driven decision-making.

🔍 Use Case Examples
Students: “What’s the average rainfall on the Big Island in February?”

Researchers: “Show me temperature anomalies for Oʻahu from 2010 to 2020.”

Policy Makers: “Was there a drought on Maui in 2023?”

Residents: “What’s the current weather station reading near Hilo?”

🛠️ Core Features
Natural Language Understanding: Users can interact with the bot using simple conversational English (no need to know climate terms or dataset names).

Smart Dataset Querying: The chatbot parses questions and maps them to relevant datasets, filtering by time range, island, metric, or event.

Quick Data Summarization: Answers are short, digestible, and tailored to the user's question — optionally followed by links to full reports or charts.

Multimodal Input (Optional): Voice or typed input to make the tool more accessible.

Deployable on Web or Messaging Platforms: Can be embedded on a website or used through messaging tools like Slack or Telegram.

🌱 Impact
Accessibility: Makes Hawaiʻi’s complex climate datasets usable by anyone, regardless of technical background.

Education: Encourages students and residents to explore and understand local climate data.

Resilience Planning: Enables faster, informed decisions by communities and leaders during climate events.

Community Engagement: Empowers people to interact with climate data, increasing transparency and trust in public data.
